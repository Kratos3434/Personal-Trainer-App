# Prerequisites
- We use npm to install our dependencies. Please ensure that you have **node js** installed if you want to run the app or backend locally.
- To be able to run the front-end app locally, you need to have an emulator in order to run it.

# Front End App
The personal trainer app is generated using react native expo. You can start it locally or directly donwload the APK for android.

**Local Installation**
- Go to your CMD or command line and type:
  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Kratos3434/Personal-Trainer-App_Frontend.git
  ```
  You need to be a collaborator in order to clone this repository. You can use **fork** to bypass this restriction if you're not part of our group.
  
- Go to the **Personal-Trainer-App_Frontend** in **VS code** or any IDE that you use. Open the integrated terminal and type:

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```
  to install any dependencies.

- To run the local expo go server in your integrated terminal, type:

  ```sh
  npx expo start --clear
  ```
  This will run the expo go server and allow you to choose either android or ios to run the app. Make sure you are using the **development build**.

- Download the development build in your emulator by visiting this link in you emulator's browser:
  
  **https://expo.dev/accounts/kwcarlos/projects/pta/builds/5d837b06-7246-4072-a2d8-68d869573ccc**
  
  **Note**: This link is set to expire by expo. To request a new link, contact the developers by creating an issue in this repository.

- Once installed in your emulator, open and enjoy the app. Please make sure that the expo go server is running.


**Offline download**
- To run the app as a standalone app without starting any server, you can download this apk by scanning this qr code on your android phone:

# Back End 
**Note**: Our backend is hosted on the cloud and you don't need to run it locally.

- Clone the app by going to your command line and type:
  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Kratos3434/Personal-Trainer-App.git
  ```

- Go to the Personal-Trainer-App folder and open it in your IDE. You may notice a lot of folder. That is generated by AWS in order to run it on the cloud.
- In your terminal, change your current directory to our source code:
  ```sh
  cd amplify\backend\function\serverRESTv1\src 
  ```

- Inside the src folder, install all of the dependencies by typing:
  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

- To run the app locally, type:
  ```sh
  node app.js
  ```

**Access the backend using REST API URL**
